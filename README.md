## How to Compile

If you are using MacOS or Linux, just open the command line, move to the 'src'-directory and run 'make'.
This should create an executable file called 'qf'.

If you are using Windows and have g++ installed, open cmd.exe and move to the 'src'-directory.
Now run this command:

<tt>g++ \*.cpp -O3 -o qf.exe</tt>

Now there should be an executable file called 'qf.exe'
